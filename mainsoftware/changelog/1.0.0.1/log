New:
The app makes desktop shortcuts for installed apps
New update method used

Changes:
The app should now be located into the app's folder, if you are running it though a EXE download and run the setup file here:  https://github.com/FlunseyTheFox/SoftwareManager/blob/master/Setup.exe?raw=true  [This will be for intergration with the SoftwareManager later]

Bug Fixes:
Disabled the maximize screen on screens that just don't look right when maximized
