NEW:
Program will show up inside of 'Add And Remove Programs" like normal programs
Built in uninstaller! (no need for the SETUP file to remove it, ironic...)
Option to hide Software Manager from "Add or remove programs" in settings
Program will auto download some missing files if found missing on launch, like a good windows program.

CHANGES:
People will no longer be annoyed because they could not figure out how to uninstall because it was not listed in 'add or remove programs'

FIXES:
None
